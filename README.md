As a part of our University Curriculum, we made this project for Database Management Systems (DBMS) - ITE1003.<br>
This project contains theoretical as well as implementation in SQL.<br>
If you liked the repo do :star: it.

## 1. Mini world and Description

In this modern era of online shopping no seller wants to be left behind, moreover due to its simplicity the shift from offline selling model to an online selling model is witnessing a rampant growth.<br>
Therefore, as an engineer our job is to ease the path of this transition for the seller.
Amongst many things that an online site requires the most important is a database system. Hence in this project we are planning to design a database where small clothing sellers can sell their product online.

## 2. Basic Structure

### 2.1 Functional requirement

- A new user can register on the website.
- A customer can see details of the product present in the cart

## 3. Implementation

You can directly copy and paste all the commands from the text given here into the SQL console to create and insert values into your table.

 
### 3.1 Inserting Values

### 4.2 PL/SQL function
#### Procedure which returns the type of product with  the cost less than the given cost
